Grocery Store Inventory

This is a console application that allows you to easily interact with inventory data. The data has been read in, cleaned, and added to a SQLite database. There are two tables, one for each CSV file. Users can view records, create records, edit and delete records, and display some analysis of the data. The users may also have the ability to create a backup of the data where two new CSV files are created reflecting the current state of the database.
